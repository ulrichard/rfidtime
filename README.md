# rfidtime
Allows you to track your working time by simply swiping an RFID token in front of an RFID reader that is connected to a bifferboard or other tiny linux computer.
The script connects directly to the database of the BORM ERP system, and records the times. You don't need to have your computer running nor to open the BORM ERP client program.

# meetings
Allows you to add meetings simply by adding a new line with an 'add_meeting()' call to the script. For me it's much simpler and less cumbersome than to click through the windows client, and calculating the times in the head and make suer everything matches up. The script does it all for you.
